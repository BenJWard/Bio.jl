A note about the default no-argument constructor. You'll notice it incompletely initializes the instance of PhyNode,
before filling in the Parent field with a reference to itself. This means the node has no parent and so could be a root,
it could also just be a node that has been created, perhaps in a function, but will be added to another  of nodes subsequently
in order to build up a tree. Alternatively the user could have just popped it off the tree. I figured a self referential
node would be the best way to do this rather than have #undef values lurking. It also allows removal of a parent from a node for something like
say the cutting / pruning of a subtree, since you simply need to  the parent field to point to itself, whereas to my knowlege, once a var in Julia
is  it cannot be made #undef.

index is used to  a node by name. For a large tree, repeatedly calling this may not be performance optimal.
To address this, I provide a method to create a dictionary based index for accessing nodes without search. This is the

I'm uncertain whether it is better to  index with a singe search of all the nodes - searchAll, or to do many
individual search()-es.
